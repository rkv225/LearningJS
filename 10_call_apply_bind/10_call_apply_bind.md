# Call, apply and bind

**Call** is a function that helps you change the context of the invoking function. In layperson's terms, it helps you replace the value of this inside a function with whatever value you want.

**Apply** is very similar to the call function. The only difference is that in apply you can pass an array as an argument list.

**Bind** is a function that helps you create another function that you can execute later with the new context of this that is provided.
