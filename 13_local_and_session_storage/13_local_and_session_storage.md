## Session Storage

When we store data in a session storage, then the data is persisted only for that particular session. Session data is not sent to server while making network calls and has a larger capacity of of more than 5mb.

## Local Storage

Data is persisted inside the browser and we can set the custom expiry of it. The data stored inside the local storage follow the same origin policy. Same origin means protocol, domain, host and port should be same when our application wants to access data for that particular application.
